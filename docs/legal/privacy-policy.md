# Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 2026

## 1. Introduction

MimikaStudio ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the MimikaStudio application.

## 2. Information Collection

MimikaStudio is designed to be local-first. We do not collect personal information by default. We do not track your usage behavior or sell data to third parties. Your voice recordings, text inputs, and generated outputs remain on your device unless you choose to share them.

## 3. On-Device Processing

Voice cloning and text-to-speech features run locally using on-device AI models. This means your content is processed entirely on your device and is not sent to external servers for processing.

## 4. Data Storage

All files you import or generate are stored locally on your device in locations you select. You control when and how to delete or share this data.

## 5. Third-Party Services

The application may utilize system-level services provided by your operating system. Optional update or license checks may transmit basic app and device metadata (such as version and OS information), but no user content is transmitted. If third-party services are enabled in future releases, this policy will be updated accordingly.

## 6. Data Security

Since your data stays on your device, the security of your data depends on the security of your device. We recommend using standard device security features such as passcodes or biometrics.

## 7. Children's Privacy

The Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
